Introduction to basic concepts and methods used in statistical data analysis, includes descriptive statistics, sampling, and inferential methods while emphasizing problem solving and critical thinking. Data comparisons such as t-tests and ANOVA will also be covered. StatCrunch is used to perform statistical calculations, organize and analyze data, and construct graphs. Required for Utah Level 2 Math Endorsement. Students are cautioned to check degree and/or transfer requirements before taking this course. This course was selected to participate in Dixie State University's Supplemental Instruction (SI) Program. This course adds one weekly class SI session but does not increase credit hours. SI is a series of weekly review sessions, led by peer SI leaders and designed to help students succeed in their academic pursuits. SI is provided for students who want to improve their understanding of course material and improve their grades. Inclusive Access Course Material fees may apply, see Fees tab under each course section for details. **COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES (CLOs) At the successful conclusion of this course, students will be able to: 1. Define statistics and think statistically; distinguish between population and sample, parameter and statistic, qualitative and quantitative variables, discrete and continuous variables. 2. Organize and summarize qualitative and quantitative date using different display methods including frequency/relative frequency distribution, bar graph, pie chart, histogram, and stem-and-leaf etc.; Compute and interpret descriptive statistics, including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and five number summary with box plot. 3. Draw and interpret scatter diagrams; compute and interpret linear correlation coefficient; find and interpret the least-squares regression line and use the line to make predictions. 4. Identify sample space and events of a probability experiment; apply probability rules including addition rule and multiplication rule; identify mutually exclusive events and independent events; solve counting problems including multiplication rule, permutation and combination; Interpret probability distributions including binomial distribution, uniform distribution and normal distribution. 5. Describe sampling distribution of sample mean and sample proportion; Construct and interpret confidence interval for population proportion, population mean and population standard deviation. 6. Test hypotheses about one sample and two samples population proportion, population mean and population standard deviation using both classical approach and p-value approach; Perform goodness-of-fit test for distributions and one-way ANOVA test for three or more means."
